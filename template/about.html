        <p>Our project, the Stroke Probability Detector, is a tool designed to predict the likelihood of individuals experiencing a stroke. 
            By analyzing various factors such as age, gender, medical history, and lifestyle habits, our tool calculates the probability 
            of stroke occurrence. It aims to raise awareness about stroke risk factors and empower individuals to take proactive steps 
            towards better health. While our tool provides valuable insights, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional 
            for personalized advice and further evaluation.</p>
        <p>We've employed a comprehensive approach, integrating various components such as dataset collection, machine learning model training, 
            frontend development, and backend implementation.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Dataset Collection:</strong> To develop our prediction model, we collected a diverse dataset containing information on factors associated with stroke risk. This dataset includes demographic data, medical history, lifestyle habits, and other relevant variables.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Machine Learning Model Training:</strong> Using the collected dataset, we trained a machine learning model to analyze the relationships between different risk factors and stroke occurrence. Through iterative training and validation processes, we optimized the model's predictive accuracy.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Frontend Development:</strong> Our frontend interface provides a user-friendly platform for individuals to input their information and receive predictions regarding their stroke risk. We designed the interface to be intuitive and accessible, ensuring a seamless user experience.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Backend Implementation with Flask:</strong> For the backend infrastructure, we utilized Flask, a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. Flask enables us to handle user requests, process data, and communicate with the machine learning model seamlessly. We implemented the Flask application using Visual Studio Code, a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) that facilitates efficient coding and debugging.</p>
